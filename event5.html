       <h4> Reflection </h4>
       <p> 
Teacher's Day is an important event that appreciates teachers and their hard work to teach many students to become better people.  Teacher's are very important in our society because they are the ones who shape and help discipline people. I realized that teaching is not only about lessons and lectures but also shapes the future of the country.  I can apply this in real-life situations by giving respect and cooperation to my dear teachers, and help them feel that they are appreciated.  I actively participated in their class discussions and help make the program for teacher's day.
<br> <br>
If I were to teach this topic, I would share the life stories of my teachers, how they sacrificed so much just to teach us, their students, and how they work hard to make sure that we understand their lectures.  It is important to celebrate this important event because it makes them feel wanted and appreciated for all their hard works they poured into their jobs and life.
