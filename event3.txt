       <h4> Reflection </h4>
       <p> 
This month, I learned the importance of innovation and how we students help our world become a better place. Experiencing these events helped me learned how to improve more as a student. By competing in STEMAZING, I improved my critical thinking and how to work under pressure.  I also participated in poster making contest about the theme in science month, which helped me enhance my creativity. Most importantly, the WINS corner has helped me and my classmates become more hygienic and how to work together to showcase our wall.  
<br> <br>
If I were to teach this topic, I would explain this by first discussing the importance of science month. Secondly, I would say that these activities will not only help you academically, but will also help you to become better at researching and thinking critically at the most important moment of your life. Moving on, this event is important because it showcases the talents of students with their creativity, critical thinking, and how to cooperate together with other people alongside unity.
