       <h4> Reflection </h4>
       <p> 
This month has taught me many things, such as the importance of being aware in issues in our countries.  Being socially aware will help us be more active in participating in government programs. AP Month is very important due to helping students learn about the United Nations, other Asian countries, and to actively participate in many more events. I actively participated in the events by drawing an editorial cartoon, quiz bee, and joining a seminar about the West Philippine Sea. 
<br> <br>
If I were to teach this topic, I would teach it by explaining the importance of being socially aware of the issues in our country.  I would also include activities such as quiz bees so that many students can showcase their talents academically. This is an important event because as I said, many students need to become more aware of the issues that are circulating in our society. We need to protect our rights as Filipinos and help our country rise and become great again.
