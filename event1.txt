       <h4> Reflection </h4>
       <p> 
Buwan ng Wika taught me the most important value as a Filipino, which is to love our country and protect our rights.  During this month, I have observed many situations in which people disrespect our language and culture, which really disappoints me because I believe that our country is a beautiful place where people can express themselves freely.  Yes, there are many problems that we have to address, but in my opinion, if we all unite and serve our country, we will be successful and become a first-world country.  I can apply these by spreading to my fellow youth how to respect our culture and educate them with our values and manners. 
<br><br>
Yes, I actively participated in these events during the buwan ng wika by performing a 'dula' as a performance task and winning the best costume in grade 9. If I were to teach this topic, I would explain it by first discussing how to respect and appreciate the culture of Filipinos.  I would then explain how our country fought for freedom, and the youth are the hope of this country. Additionally, it is important to have an event per subject so that students will not only study, but also enjoy different events prepared by clubs.
