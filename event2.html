       <h4> Reflection </h4>
       <p> 
Intramurals week was the most tiring but fun week I experienced this school year.  The most important thing that I learning from the event is how to be a good sport and to just enjoy playing with your teammates.  People who play fairly and follow the rules of the game are the people whom I look up to because I know that they are honest and disciplined people who just want to play and enjoy their time.  I can apply what I learned in real-life situations by being honest in my everyday life and by becoming a disciplined person who respects everyone. 
<br> <br>
Yes, I actively participated in the events by playing volleyball(1st Runner-up) and Athletics (1st Runner-up). If I were to teach this topic, I would teach them by explaining how to play fairly and follow the rules of the game.  I would also teach them how to respect players and be an honest sport.  It is important to have this event so that students who do not excel academically can showcase their talents through sports.
